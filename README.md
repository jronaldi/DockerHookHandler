# DockerHookHandler
Dockerized daemon that will trigger a script upon a Docker webhook notification.
I am creating this small app to automatically deploy new versions of a Docker image when one is available. There are many alternatives to this, but I'm doing this one:
- in ASP.NET Core.
- will be dockerized to run on my servers along all other microservices.
